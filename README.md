# 📋 Requirements

Before running the project, ensure the following software is installed:

- Python **3.10** or later
- Node.js **18** or later (includes npm)
- Git

Verify your installation:

```bash
python --version
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

---

# ⚙️ Setup

## Automatic Setup and Start (Windows PowerShell)

From the project root, install dependencies once, then start the application:

```powershell
.\setup.ps1
.\start.ps1
```

The launcher runs the backend from `backend/` and the frontend from `frontend/`.
Open http://localhost:5173 for the dashboard; the API runs at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Keep the terminal open and press **Ctrl+C** to stop both servers.
For subsequent launches, only run `.\start.ps1`.

## Manual Setup and Start

Use two terminals, starting each from the project root.

### 1. Backend

In the first terminal, install the backend dependencies and start the API:

```bash
cd backend
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Backend runs at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

### 2. Frontend

In the second terminal, install the frontend dependencies and start the dashboard:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

For subsequent launches, skip the install commands and run the start command in
each folder: `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload` in `backend/` and
`npm run dev` in `frontend/`. Press **Ctrl+C** in each terminal to stop its server.
